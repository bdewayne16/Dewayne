<h2> About Me</h2>
<p> Growing up in Queens was the best thing to happeen to me.
	Even though im just in one area of NYC, i felt like i was
	was connected to all other boroughs. The diversity, quick 
	transportation, and high revenue made my area busy but also
	fun to be arond. I like going out but stating home is somthing
	i admire more because i like to relax. One way to make me really 
	stay home is playing video games. Theres a game coming out thats
	a sequel and 5 years in the making. I cant wait. </p>
